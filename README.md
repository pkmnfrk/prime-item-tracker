Metroid Prime Item Tracker
==========================

This tool is designed to easily keep track of your items in a Metroid Prime Randomizer run. It has
spots for every major upgrade and item.

For most items, just click on them to highlight them, indicating they have been collected. For tank
items (Energy Tanks, etc) clicking on them will increment the count, while Shift-Clicking on them
will decrement the count.
